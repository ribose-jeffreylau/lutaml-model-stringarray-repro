= Lutaml Modelling for array fields cast from string

This is a repo to demonstrate attempts to model a string array
that is cast from a comma-separated string,
in link:https://github.com/lutml/lutaml-model[lutaml-model^].

== Problem

Given a comma-separated string,
how can it be modelled as an array field in Lutaml?

== Minimal Examples of various approaches

For minimal examples of the different approaches,
head over to:

link:./spec/string_array_spec.rb[^]:: no `collection: true`; casting attempted in custom attribute class.
link:./spec/string_collection_spec.rb[^]:: `collection: true` but no casting attempted.
link:./spec/cast_string_collection_spec.rb[^]:: `collection: true` with casting attempted in custom attribute class.

== Question

Is this use case supported in Lutaml Model?

If so, what is the correct way to model it?
